<p><b>3. </b><strong><b>It helps to avoid cramps</b></strong></p>
<p>Watermelon is a great help for all people who practice sports. Because it contains a high amount of potassium and vitamin B6, this fruit is ideal to avoid the cramps that crack our muscles when we carry out physical effort. These components help our body to better absorb protein, thus avoiding cramps. For this purpose, it is best to eat a little watermelon a few minutes before exercising. It can also be consumed after practicing sports, as it is very refreshing because of its high water content.</p>
<p><b>4. </b><strong><b>It prevents high blood pressure and heart health</b></strong></p>
<p>Several recent studies claim that watermelon is beneficial to the heart because its daily intake maintains blood pressure and blood pressure at good levels, preventing heart and vascular disease. Potassium and magnesium in watermelons, and the presence of an amino acid called citrulline, helps to reduce high blood pressure and general cardiovascular function.</p>

<p><strong><b>5. Relieve muscle pain</b></strong></p>
<p>The high levels of lycopene in watermelon makes it a natural anti-inflammatory, making it ideal to eat if you are sore after a long journey. Watermelon also contains choline, to suppress inflammatory responses.  Reducing inflammation can benefit people with a wide variety of conditions, from long-term illnesses, such as arthritis, or temporary pains. Another study found that men who drank unpasteurized watermelon juice before work saw the pain reduced a day later, compared to those who took a placebo.</p>
<p><strong><b>6. Ideal for skin and hair treatment</b></strong></p>
<p>If your skin and hair look tired, do not buy expensive products, reach the watermelon. Watermelons contain a quarter of our recommended daily allowance of vitamin A, which helps keep hair and skin hydrated and promotes the growth of new collagen and cells, keeping us young, thanks to elastin. Vitamin C is also essential for healthy collagen growth.</p>
<p>Watermelon is also a very good source of manganese. Manganese improves the appearance of the skin, increasing the production of collagen and reducing inflammation.</p>

<p><strong><b>10. Watermelon burns fat</b></strong></p>
<p><strong><b> </b></strong>The presence of a substance called citrulline in watermelon has proven to reduce fat absorption. Citrulline is an amino acid that is converted to arginine using the kidneys. Thus, citrulline causes the activity of certain enzymes that promote fat storage to be blocked.</p>
